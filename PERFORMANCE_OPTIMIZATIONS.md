# Performance Optimizations for Ferreiras.Me App

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting & Dynamic Imports
- Implemented dynamic imports for all major components
- Reduced initial bundle size by lazy loading non-critical components
- Components loaded: ContactForm, GoldParticles, ImageModal, CountdownTimer, WhatsAppButton, NewsletterForm, BrandHighlights, InstagramFeed

### 2. Image Optimization
- Installed and configured Sharp for Next.js image optimization
- Configured WebP and AVIF formats in next.config.js
- Created OptimizedImage component with:
  - Lazy loading
  - Blur placeholder support
  - Error handling
  - Automatic responsive sizing
- Created image optimization script at `/scripts/optimize-images.js`
- Run `npm run optimize-images` to generate optimized versions

### 3. Service Worker & PWA
- Implemented service worker for offline functionality at `/public/sw.js`
- Added manifest.json for PWA support
- Caching strategies:
  - Network first with cache fallback for pages
  - Cache first for images
  - Background sync for form submissions

### 4. Font Optimization
- Configured fonts with `display: 'swap'` for better loading
- Added preconnect and dns-prefetch for Google Fonts
- Using font subsetting to reduce file size

### 5. Resource Prefetching
- Created ResourcePrefetch component to preload critical resources
- Prefetches critical images and API routes
- Uses requestIdleCallback for non-critical resources

### 6. Bundle Size Optimization
- Configured webpack splitChunks for optimal code splitting
- Added bundle analyzer (run `npm run analyze`)
- Separate chunks for:
  - Framework (React, React-DOM)
  - Large libraries (>160KB)
  - Common modules
  - Shared code

### 7. CSS Optimization
- Created critical.css for above-the-fold content
- Enabled CSS optimization in Next.js config
- Using CSS-in-JS for component-specific styles

### 8. JavaScript Performance
- Optimized GoldParticles component:
  - Reduced particle count from 50 to 20
  - Added prefers-reduced-motion support
  - Delayed initialization after page load
  - Added will-change CSS property
- Created useOptimizedAnimation hook with:
  - Intersection Observer for lazy animations
  - Debounce and throttle utilities
  - RequestAnimationFrame usage

### 9. Performance Monitoring
- Integrated Web Vitals monitoring
- Tracks Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB, INP
- Long task detection
- Navigation timing metrics
- Ready for analytics integration

### 10. Next.js Configuration
- Enabled SWC minification
- Configured image formats and sizes
- Set 1-year cache TTL for images
- Enabled compression
- Removed console logs in production
- Disabled powered-by header

## Usage Instructions

### Running Performance Analysis
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Optimize images
npm run optimize-images

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run start
```

### Performance Best Practices
1. Always use OptimizedImage component instead of Next.js Image
2. Wrap heavy components with dynamic imports
3. Use the useOptimizedAnimation hook for scroll-triggered animations
4. Monitor Web Vitals in production
5. Keep images under 200KB (optimized versions)
6. Lazy load below-the-fold content
7. Use proper cache headers for static assets

### Monitoring Performance
- Check console for Web Vitals metrics in production
- Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse for audits
- Monitor bundle size with the analyzer
- Track long tasks in Performance tab

## Next Steps
1. Implement CDN for static assets
2. Add edge caching with Vercel or Cloudflare
3. Consider implementing Partytown for third-party scripts
4. Add resource hints for external domains
5. Implement adaptive loading based on network speed
